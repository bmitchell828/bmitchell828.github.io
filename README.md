# Blake Mitchell's Very Mid Website

This is my attempt to make a personal website in html using git pages. It is a learning exercise. 

## What's included

- `index.html` — main site file (already copied into `docs/` for GitHub Pages)
- `docs/` — directory served by GitHub Pages (contains `index.html` and `.nojekyll`)

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push your repository to GitHub.
2. In your repository on GitHub, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch" and choose the branch (usually `main`) and the `/docs` folder.
4. Save — GitHub Pages will build and publish the site. The URL will be shown on the Pages settings page.
